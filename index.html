 				 <b>2008–2011: Beginnings and Blackland Radio 66.6</b><br>
 				In high school, Rolle began skateboarding frequently but later decided that he wanted to pursue a career in music. He worked to graduate from high school early. Rolle began uploading music once he created his YouTube channel "Spaceeghostpurrpmj23" on May 23, 2010.Rolles early releases contained series of visuals that included Purrped & Chopped songs containing visuals with 70/80s soul-train aesthetics, Purrped & chopped Toro y Moi songs & even a Kreayshawn music video. In August, 2010 Rolle began working on NASA: The Mixtape. Rolle formed hip-hop collective Raider Klan in 2008 along with Dough Dough Da Don, Kadafi, Muney Junior, and Jitt. Jitt died in 2010. SpaceGhostPurrp recruited various rap artists to Raider Klan, including Denzel Curry, Yung Simmie, Nell, Chris Travis, Xavier Wulf, Rell, Amber London, and Key Nyata, among many others.

At the tail end of 2010 and early 2011, Rolle began collaborating with Lil Ugly Mane.Which led to Ugly Mane doing the artwork for his album Blackland Radio 66.6, Around that same time, Rolle began working on the mixtape Blackland Radio 66.6 mixtape.

After Blackland Radio 66.6 was released on May 1, 2011, a few weeks later Rolle announced he was working on five mixtapes that were all to be released in 2011 called MIND OF PURRP, SUMMA PHONK VOL.ONE, TRILLUMINATTI, BLVCK MVRDOC, and a collaboration project with Mishka NYC called SON OF EYE. Rolle dropped singles for all these mixtapes however rolle never released these mixtapes due to his change of direction once he landed & stayed in New York to begin collaborating with the ASAP Mob. In the summer of 2011, Rolle was also working with fellow rappers Speak! and Juicy J.Rolle went on to NY in August 2011 to live and work with members from the ASAP Mob. In late september 2011, Rolle announced he was dismissing Trilluminatti and now was working on a new mixtape to be called GOD OF BLVCK. This mixtape later dropped in February 2012.<br>
<b>2012–2013: Mysterious Phonk: The Chronicles of SpaceGhostPurrp</b><br>
In early 2012 Rolle signed a one-off record deal with British indie label 4AD and began remixing tracks from his earlier mix tapes for his debut album. Most of his early songs feature samples from sources such as train whistles, female porn stars, and drops from the soundtrack of the Mortal Kombat video game, as well as other video game series.In addition to his own songs, he also produces beats for other artists (mostly those in the Raider Klan), but has made beats for other people as well. He produced one track titled T.A.P. for Taylor Allderdice, a mixtape by Wiz Khalifa as well as "Keep it G" & "Pretty Flacko" for ASAP Rocky.

His debut album, titled Mysterious Phonk: Chronicles of SpaceGhostPurrp, was released on June 12, 2012, and consists of mostly remixed tracks from previous mixtapes. He occasionally worked with rapper Juicy J and has produced a number of tracks from Juicy J's "Blue Dream & Lean". He also guest stars on Juicy J's "Deez Bitches Rollin'" with rapper fellow Speakz. Rolle also featured on Domo Genesis's & The Alchemist's debut collaboration album "No Idols" on the track "Daily News" (also featuring Earl Sweatshirt & Action Bronson), as well as Freddie Gibbs' "Kush Cloud" along with Krayzie Bone. Rolle revealed in an interview that there is an upcoming project between him and rap group Odd Future, which has supported him by playing his music at shows since he released the mixtape BLACKLAND RADIO 66.6. On July 16, 2012, Rolle began his first tour with hardcore punk band Trash Talk. The mini tour lasted from July 16 to 23rd - performing four shows in California, one in Oregon, and two in Washington. His song "The Black God" was named #46 on Pitchfork's 50 best songs of 2012 list.He also performed in Miami during Ultra Music Festival on March 17, 2013 alongside fellow Raider Klan members Yung Simmie and Klan Rico.<br>
<b>2016–present: Blackland Radio 66.6 2 and 3</b><br>
On May 9, 2016, Rolle released a mixtape entitled Blackland Radio 66.6 Pt. 2. exclusively on Datpiff. He had stated that he had plans to release subsequent volumes under Part 2, but eventually opted to skip straight to the release of Blackland Radio 3 on March 4, 2018.

As 2016 concluded, Tiny Mix Tapes recognized Rolle 's Black Money Boys Death Row (BMB) collective as one of its favorite labels for 2016.

BMB’s sound is a sinister twist on the MySpace-era material churned out by Soulja Boy and Lil B, tinged with Glo Gang’s hazy drill hedonism. Affiliates’ discographies are often spread across multiple SoundCloud accounts, hosted by friends, buried in prolific back catalogues, and are sometimes deleted days after their conception. To follow BMB Death Row is to keep their web presence under constant surveillance or risk missing out on a clutch new cut.

In early 2017, Rolle signed a deal with label Yeah We On Entertainment, LLC, with the label distributing previously released works by SpaceGhostPurrp under its name.<br>
In a YouTube stream on August 25, 2019 that was later re-uploaded, Rolle addressed that he is on the autism spectrum.

 			<p class="mainText">
 				SpaceGhostPurrp has listed many artists as an influence, which include Kanye West, Wiz Khalifa, Gucci Mane, Poison Clan, Paris,[26] Three 6 Mafia, UGK, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, Big L, Eazy-E, 2Pac, and DJ Screw.<br>

He has collaborated with many of his influences, namely Juicy J on his mixtape "Blue Dream & Lean" released in 2012. SpaceGhostPurrp often attributes his dark "phonk" sound to the dangerous and violent environment he grew up around in Carol City which he refers to as "Blackland", linking it with his references to hell, and the satanic symbolism in his critically acclaimed mixtape Blackland Radio 66.6. He as well as other Raider Klan members have made references to the shooting of Trayvon Martin, and he has made a tribute song titled "No Evidence" which was released on his album "Mysterious Phonk: The Chronicles of SpaceGhostPurrp". SpaceGhostPurrp has also stated he is a big fan of extreme metal bands such as Meshuggah.

His name is derived from that of the central character of the 1994 parody talk show Space Ghost Coast to Coast.
